# Progress report to PI (last week of March)
## What has been done in March
* Sumbitted ACS conference abstract. (3/10)
* New methods and models were applied in forecasting ammonia
* Thesis outline is updated in March.

## Timeline
* 11/29 &rarr; Group presentation:  
Compare traditional models (Random Forest) vs deep learning models (DNN and LSTM) on ammonia forecasting.
* 1/21 &rarr; Group presentation:  
Introduce two data smoothing filters and outlier removal methods to perform data cleaning with more deep learning models.
* 2/21 &rarr; Progress report to Dr. Yin (to confrim the ACS abstract content)
* 2/25 &rarr; Last day of calibrating colour spectrophotometer in SHW.
* 3/12 &rarr; Submission of ACS abstract.

## Progress report
__Key findings__
1. Train ammonia forecasting model with colour decreased the model performance.
2. New method was used to increase the model training data quality (i.e., feature engineering).
3. New state-of-the-art model (Transformer) is used and a better model performance is achieved compared to LSTM and DNN.
