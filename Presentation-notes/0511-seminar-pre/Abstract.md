# UV/electrooxidation lag operation for UV254 absorbance reduction in landfill leachate: operational considerations for municipal sewage co-treatment  

Abstract:  
Landfill leachate co-treatment with municipal sewage is an economical strategy limited by the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in leachate. The discharged DOM exhibits high ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) and thus hinders the UV disinfection efficiency at downstream wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Here, the UVA254 was alleviated by optimizing the current density and irradiation timing of a UV/electrooxidation (UV/EO) process to accumulate the generating chlorine and accelerate its photolysis. At an optimal 200 A·m−2, the UV irradiation was delayed by 10 min to accumulate 21 mg·L−1 as Cl2 of chlorine, enhancing its initial photolysis rate by 5.25 times compared with a simultaneous UV/EO. After 60 min, the lag operation produced ClO• and Cl2•− at respective steady-state concentrations of 4.11 × 10−14 M and 1.09 × 10−14 M and reduced the UVA254 in leachate DOM by 78.2%. The results indicate that aromatic formulas with low oxygen content were susceptible to UV/EO from Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) analysis. After quenching the residual chlorine, leachate co-treatment at 3.5% (v/v) resulted in specific oxygen uptake rates (SOUR) comparable with municipal sewage. The findings provide operational insight for applying UV/EO in high UVA254 matrices such as landfill leachate.
