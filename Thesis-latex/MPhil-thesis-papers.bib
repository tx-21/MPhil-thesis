  abstract = {Chemical oxygen demand (COD) has been utilized to determine the content of organic matter of bath water, wastewater and natural water, due to the time consuming of biological oxygen demand (BOD) test, COD became an alternative in controlling the treatment process. For the oxidation of both organic and inorganic matter COD may be expressed as one of the demand parameters. In this paper, the Artificial neural network (ANNs) was employed to develop and estimate the effluent COD model from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), to evaluate the model, the daily recorded data sets were obtained from the new Nicosia WWT, the input parameters of ANNs are inlets COD, BOD, pH, Conductivity, Total Nitrogen (T-N), Total Phosphates (T-P), Total suspended solid (TSS), Suspended solid (SS) and the effluent COD were considered as an output neuron of ANN. The ANN performance has been evaluated using statistical techniques (Determination coefficient, RMSE, Correlations), the result of ANNs model was compared with the Multilinear regression analysis (MLR) and the efficiency revealed that ANNs model showed the prominent accuracy and better performance in predicting the effluent COD over the MLR model.},

We analysed water consumption data from 11,528 households over 20 weeks from January 2020, revealing clusters of households with distinctive temporal patterns. We present a data-driven household water consumer segmentation characterising households' unique consumption patterns and we demonstrate how the understanding of the impact of these patterns of behaviour on network demand during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown can improve the accuracy of demand forecasting. Our results highlight those groupings with the highest and lowest impact on water demand across the network, revealing a significant quantifiable change in water consumption patterns during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The implications of the study to urban water demand forecasting strategies are discussed, along with proposed future research directions.},

  abstract = {Many communities in South Africa struggle to access reliable and adequate quantities of potable water for diverse water requirements. This is against the backdrop of decreasing freshwater availability and increasing water demands. Currently, interest in the reuse of wastewater for non-drinking water requirements is increasing. This paper therefore provides an overview of the South African water resources situation and wastewater1 generation in order to put the need for wastewater reuse into perspective. Potential for broader implementation and parameters influencing wastewater reuse based on local attitudes and experience were discussed with recommendations to facilitate broader implementation of wastewater reuse. This paper concludes that significant potential exists for implementing wastewater reuse for large non-drinking applications (e.g. landscape irrigation and industrial processes) in arid areas of South Africa especially Western Cape Province. Parameters highlighted from local attitudes and experience to influence broader implementation in addition to aridity include distance from source, retrofitting versus new installations, quantity of reuse, tariffs, source quality, public health, willingness, public trust and knowledge, and regulations and guidelines for reuse. Prior to implementation, it is recommended that these parameters be addressed.},

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

  abstract = {Jordan is considered an arid to semi-arid country. Water resources in Jordan comprise of conventional resources (ground water and surface water) and non-conventional resources mainly treated wastewater. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to provide predictions for the quality of treated effluent from Wadi Arab wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)-Phase1. This plant serves South-West of Irbid city. The treated effluent of Wadi Arab WWTP is used for irrigation. Four ANN models were developed to predict effluent quality of Wadi Arab WWTP-Phase1, namely BOD5, COD, SS, NH4-N. A systematic approach was employed to find the most appropriate architecture for each ANN model. The influent flow rate (Q), Temperature, pH, BOD5, COD, SS and NH4-N were the input quality parameters for each ANN model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to uncover the prediction uncertainty of an ANN model to variations in each input parameter. The analyses showed that all four ANN models were highly sensitive to influent pH,while all were slightly sensitive to influent SS. This study found that ANN models were reasonably robust and they could be used to alert plant staff of future problems such as those indicated in the above scenarios. The results showed that ANN models are beneficial to manage the treatment process in Wadi Arab WWTP, to produce effluent quality within the Jordanian Standards for irrigation, and to protect the ecosystem in the Jordan Valley.},

This study investigates the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the influent BOD5 concentration and the performance of WWTPs. The WWTP performance was defined in terms of the COD, BOD, and TSS concentrations in the effluent. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the best-performing ANN network structure and configuration. The results showed that the ANN model developed to predict the BOD concentration performed the best among the three outputs. The topperforming ANN models yielded R2 values of 0.752, 0.612, and 0.631 for the prediction of the BOD, COD, and TSS concentrations, respectively. The optimal performing models were obtained (three inputs \textendash{} one output), which indicated that the influent temperature and conductivity greatly affect the WWTP performance as inputs in all models. The developed prediction model for the influent BOD5 concentration attained a high accuracy, i.e., R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.754, which implies that the model is viable as a soft sensor for online control and management systems for WWTPs. Overall, the ANN model provides a simple approach for the prediction of the complex processes of WWTPs.},

The results obtained in Anele et al. (2017) showed that hybrid models may be considered as the accurate and appropriate forecasting models for STWD prediction. However, such best single valued forecast does not guarantee reliable and robust decisions, which can be properly obtained via model uncertainty processors (MUPs). MUPs provide an estimate of the full predictive densities and not only the single valued expected prediction. Amongst other MUPs, the purpose of this paper is to use the multi-variate version of the model conditional processor (MCP), proposed by Todini (2008), to demonstrate how the estimation of the predictive probability conditional to a number of relatively good predictive models may improve our knowledge, thus reducing the predictive uncertainty (PU) when forecasting into the unknown future. Through the MCP approach, the probability distribution of the future water demand can be assessed depending on the forecast provided by one or more deterministic forecasting models. Based on an average weekly data of 168 h, the probability density of the future demand is built conditional on three models' predictions, namely the autoregressive-moving average (ARMA), feed-forward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN) and hybrid model (i.e., combined forecast from ARMA and FFBP-NN). The results obtained show that MCP may be effectively used for real-time STWD prediction since it brings out the PU connected to its forecast, and such information could help water utilities estimate the risk connected to a decision.},

However, whole plant and resource recovery modelling requires primary settler model development, as current models lack detail in describing the dynamics and the diversity of the removal process for different particulate fractions. This paper focuses on the improved modelling and experimental characterization of primary settlers. First, a new modelling concept based on particle settling velocity distribution is proposed which is then applied for the development of an improved primary settler model as well as for its characterization under addition of chemicals (chemically enhanced primary treatment, CEPT). This model is compared to two existing simple primary settler models (Otterpohl and Freund; Lessard and Beck), showing to be better than the first one and statistically comparable to the second one, but with easier calibration thanks to the ease with which wastewater characteristics can be translated into model parameters. Second, the changes in the activated sludge model (ASM)-based chemical oxygen demand fractionation between inlet and outlet induced by primary settling is investigated, showing that typical wastewater fractions are modified by primary treatment. As they clearly impact the downstream processes, both model improvements demonstrate the need for more detailed primary settler models in view of whole plant modelling.},

Sludge volume index (SVI) should be monitored to predict sludge bulking for a wastewater treatment plant. This study was an effort to develop hybrid artificial neural network-genetic algorithm models (MLPANN-GA and RBFANN-GA) to accurately predict SVI. Operating parameters, including MLVSS, pH, DO, temperature, TSS, COD and total nitrogen were the inputs of neural networks. Genetic algorithm was utilized in order to optimize weights and thresholds of the MLPANN and RFBANN models. Training procedures for SVI estimation were successful for both the MLPANN-GA and RBFANN-GA models. The training and validation models showed an almost perfect match between experimental and predicted values of SVI. The results indicated that with low experimental values of input data to train ANNs, the MLPANN-GA compared with the RBFANN-GA is more accurate due to higher coefficient of determination (R2) and lower root mean squared error (RMSE) values. The values of RMSE and R2 for the optimal models approached 0 and 1, respectively. The mean average error for the ANN models did not exceed 3\% of the input values of the measured SVI. The GA increased the accuracy of all the MLPANN and RBFANN models.},

It has been used in many different fields of study to analyze time series and forecast future data points; however, it has not been widely used to forecast daily wastewater influent flow. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to utilize ARIMA for daily influent flow forecasting. To pursue the objective confidently, five stations across North America are used to validate ARIMA's performance. These stations include Woodward, Niagara, North Davis, and two confidential plants. The results demonstrate that ARIMA models can produce satisfactory daily influent flow forecasts. Considering the results of this study, ARIMA models could provide the operating engineers at both municipal and rural WWTPs with sufficient information to run the stations efficiently and thus, support wastewater management and planning at various levels within a watershed.},

  abstract = {Wastewater reclamation may produce many advantages including increased water conservation, better environmental protection, and attractive economic benefits. This will be deemed critical in south Taiwan where the heavy industries are concentrated but existing water resources are unable to meet the increasing demands for water supply. One particular wastewater reuse option is aquifer recharge using treated effluents that may alleviate land subsidence issue and seawater intrusion caused by unregulated aquaculture practices in the coastal region around this area. Yet wide variations of nutrient contents in treated effluents may make the implementation process of wastewater reclamation more sensitive. This paper presents a novel approach on the basis of a neural network model that is designed to provide better predictions of nitrogen contents in treated effluents to be used for groundwater recharge. The optimal structure of a neural network model useful for evaluating the reuse potential of the effluent produced from a contact-aeration process is developed. The importance of using oxidation/reduction potential readings as an input in the model to predict the degree of nitrification achieved is demonstrated. To enhance cost effectiveness in wastewater reclamation, a rainfall index is taken into account as a useful input in the model that provides the flexibility needed in decision-making process in accordance with the weather conditions observed. Research findings indicate that a well-trained neural network model is helpful in the assessment of wastewater reclamation practice to achieve significant cost savings with modest efforts in on-line sampling and analysis.},

Moreover, the key water parameters should also be identified by the learning models, in order to further reduce prediction costs and improve prediction efficiency. Here we endeavored for the first time to compare the water quality prediction performance of 10 learning models (7 traditional and 3 ensemble models) using big data (33,612 observations) from the major rivers and lakes in China from 2012 to 2018, based on the precision, recall, F1-score, weighted F1-score, and explore the potential key water parameters for future model prediction. Our results showed that the bigger data could improve the performance of learning models in prediction of water quality. Compared to other 7 models, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and deep cascade forest (DCF) trained by data sets of pH, DO, CODMn, and NH3 eN had significantly better performance in prediction of all 6 Levels of water quality recommended by Chinese government. Moreover, two key water parameter sets (DO, CODMn, and NH3eN; CODMn, and NH3eN) were identified and validated by DT, RF and DCF to be high specificities for perdition water quality. Therefore, DT, RF and DCF with selected key water parameters could be prioritized for future water quality monitoring and providing timely water quality warning.},

Deep learning technologies as proven data-driven soft-sensors should be developed for WWTP applications to tackle the process of non-linearity and the dynamic nature of environmental data. This study adopts deep learning-based models as soft-sensors to forecast WWTP key features, such as influent flow, influent temperature, influent biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), effluent chloride, effluent BOD, and power consumption. We constructed six deep learning models derived from long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), namely traditional LSTM and GRU, the exponentially smoothed LSTM, and the adaptive version of LSTM and smoothed LSTM. The employment of a smoothed LSTM technique is expected to reduce the outlier effect and to improve forecasting accuracy. Meanwhile, the usage of adaptive deep models will enhance the capabilities of the LSTM to quickly and accurately follow the trend of future data. We compared the performance of these models with Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) and the seasonal decomposition using local regression. The historical records from a coastal municipal WWTP in Saudi Arabia are used to verify the investigated models' effectiveness. The proposed models provide promising forecasting results but require no assumptions on the data distributions. In terms of efficiency, GRU based models converge faster than LSTM based models. In terms of accuracy, the LSTM soft-sensor shows overall the optimal result for all key features followed by the exponentially-smoothed GRU and LSTM. By contrast, the adaptive models achieved the lowest forecasting performance compared to the other models. These findings will benefit practitioners to achieve data-driven WWTP management.},

Although some efforts have been made to address the issue of imbalance, little is known about the suitable technologies for drinking water quality prediction. Here, a total of 16 common learning models were applied individually to compare the drinking water quality prediction performance based on a large-scale highly imbalanced drinking water quality data set. Our results showed that ensemble, cost-sensitive learning models with higher F1-scores were more suitable for predicting drinking water quality, compared to other models tested in this study. In addition, the learning model performance could be enhanced by the introduction of two mainstream sampling algorithms [synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) combined with the Tomek links technique (TLTE) or the edited nearest neighbor technique (ENNTE), SMOTE + TLTE or SMOTE + ENNTE, respectively]. In particular, the F1-scores of deep cascade forest (DCF) with SMOTE + TLTE or SMOTE + ENNTE reached 94.54 {$\pm$} 2.51\% and 94.68 {$\pm$} 2.72\%, respectively. As a consequence, DCF with these two sampling algorithms has greater potential to be applied in drinking water quality monitoring and prediction, as well as other fields that have suffered from issues of imbalanced data.},

  abstract = {The aim of this review was to discuss the transition from traditional irrigation to fertigation using reclaimed wastewater in countries with moderate climate. In most European countries there are no regulations on waste water reuse and on the other hand there are countries where regulations are very strict. An important aspect is to standardize the restrictions, which would minimize uncontrolled use of wastewater for fertigation. Wastewater is a source of plant nutrients and organic matter, but can be contaminated with chemicals and pathogens, which in turn can lead to secondary environmental pollution. The reuse of recovered wastewater may require modification of the wastewater treatment process line or construction of stabilization tanks at farms. In both cases, it is necessary to set up initial installations in real systems in order to develop principles for irrigation with reclaimed wastewater for soil and temperate climate conditions. The additional treatment steps required are also associated with large investments, but could reduce fertilization costs and, more importantly, improve the environmental situation. The current scale of fertilizer application does not allow conventional fertilization to fulfill global demand. The introduction of such a solution is a step towards the practical application of circular economy and sustainable crop production. The paper discusses a challenges related with implementation of transition from conventional irrigation to fertigation with reclaimed wastewater in moderate climate countries. A special focus to providing fertilizer nutrients in terms of required doses was undertaken.},

  abstract = {By 2050, global demand for water is expected to increase by some 55\% due to population growth and urbani\- zation. The utilization of large amounts of freshwater in the world, generate huge volumes of wastewater of which, globally, more than 80\% is discharged without treatment, thus causing impacts on aquatic ecosystems, human health and economic productivity. More sustainable practices of wastewater management are expected as a way towards circular bioeconomy (CBE) processes, whose goal is to implement closed systems promoting the systematic use of recycling, reuse and recovery of bioproducts and by-products and the reduction of waste generation. This approach, if adopted in the water and wastewater sector, can ensure environmental, economic and social benefits. The reuse of wastewater, on the one hand, reduces the volume of wastewater and the pressure on water bodies; on the other hand, the recovery of nutrients (P or N) and/or other high value bio\- products (biogas, cellulose, biopolymers) from wastewater offers numerous advantages in terms of supplying new raw bio-based materials that can be refed back to supply chains (thus substituting fossil resources) and, at the same time, producing cleaner water to be reused. Nevertheless, while in Europe many industries have demonstrated the ability to recycle and reuse water, in many regions of Italy the sustainable management of water and wastewater is not yet consolidated. In this study we explore the available technological, economic and environmental options concerning water use and wastewater treatment and we apply them to design appropriate scenarios for improved use efficiency and circular management. A comprehensive literature review of the most promising wastewater treatment processes for resources and energy valorization was conducted. The recovery of PHAs, struvite, nitrogen and algal biomass, as potential substitutes for conventional PET, phosphate and nitrogen chemical fertilizers and electricity, respectively, in addition to reusable treated water, were hypothesized and carefully discussed. Resulting scenarios are tested against the present situation of Campania Region (situated in Southern Italy) based on population and demand statistics, in order to develop strategies and policies potentially applicable locally and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Water quality failure is a long-standing problem worldwide, causing illness, poisoning, disease outbreak, and claiming human lives in the urban communities. Potable water can be compromised due to a myriad of physical, operational, and environmental factors, such as contaminants intrusion into water pipelines, leaching, disinfection byproducts, chemical or microbial permeation, and pollution. The prediction of potable water quality has seldom been researched, while a novel automated model that offers a proactive approach can be developed to promote sustainability-based strategies. This paper elaborates the impacts of the aforementioned factors on the quality of potable water using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and risk analysis techniques. The ANN model was developed based on historical data obtained from the water distribution networks (WDNs) of the City of El Pedregal, Peru. The data were streamlined and fed to the neural network to be trained. Subsequent to multiple iterations via the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the optimized performance was generated and passed to the trained network to forecast the water quality failure in WDNs. The model performance was tested and validated against different statistical error terms and indicators. The mean absolute error and root-mean-squared error in the ANN failure prediction were computed as 0.08 and 0.15, whereas the average validity of the network was generated to be 92\%. Based on the trained neural network, the degree of influence of each factor was determined through implementing a sensitivity analysis. It was found that water quality, water pressure, and operational and maintenance practices had the maximum influence on the risk of failure in water infrastructure. Policy makers and managers can benefit from the proposed model since ANN is already trained, by predicting water quality whenever new data become available. Prediction results will indicate the level of risk (low, moderate, high) to the inhabitants, thereby preemptive measures can be taken to avoid any illness or disease outbreak.},

The main objective of this paper is to design an event-triggered control strategy such that the computation burden can be reduced effectively while maintaining the desired system performance. Unlike existing model predictive control (MPC), the controller in the proposed ETMPC takes action when certain event conditions are satisfied, and thus can reduce the communication and computation resource caused by continuous controller update. The triggering condition is designed according to the system output error and the prediction step of the MPC controller, and thus is easy to check. Moreover, a state space model of the studied nitrogen removal process is built, based on which the ETMPC is designed. The controller is developed to maintain the tracking performance of the dissolved oxygen concentration and nitrate nitrogen concentration by adjusting two key variables in the WWTPs. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system under the designed control strategy is conducted by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Some simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the number of controller update by up to 60\% compared with MPC, whereas the ISE only increases by about 0.1, which is acceptable for WWTPs.},

The application of data-driven modeling techniques, however, bears some risk because the generated models are of non-mechanistic nature and they thus do not always describe the plant processes appropriately. In this study, a procedure to build software sensors based on sensor data available in the process information system is defined and used to compare several techniques suitable for data-driven modeling, including generalized least squares regression, artificial neural networks, self-organizing maps and random forests. Three different degrees of expert knowledge are defined and considered mainly for optimum input signal selection and model interpretation. In two full-scale experiments, software sensors are created. The experiments reveal that even with linear modeling techniques, it is possible to automatically generate accurate software sensors. Hence, this justifies the selection of the most parsimonious and transparent models and to motivate their investigation by taking into account available expert knowledge. A high degree of expert knowledge is valuable for long-term accuracy, but can lead to performance decreases in short-term predictions. With regard to safe on-site deployment, the consideration of uncertainty measures is crucial to prevent misinterpretation of software-sensor outputs in the cases of rare events or model input failures. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Expectation of wastewater quality in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is significant and can decrease the sampling number, cost, decision time, and energy. This paper presents two methods for predicting and fore\- casting the removal efficiency of total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological ox\- ygen demand (BOD5), ammonia, and sulphide at El-Berka wastewater treatment plant, Egypt. The first method uses different prediction models, includes the use of traditional feed-forward (TF), deep feed-forward back\- propagation (DFB), and deep cascade-forward backpropagation (DCB) networks. The TF was generated in three layers: input, hidden, and an output layer. The DFB network comprised of six layers: an input, four hidden, and an output layer. The DCB network was created with six layers (with skip connections): an input, four hidden, and an output layer. The other method is a forecasting model by using deep learning time series forecasting (DLTSF) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The developed models were trained, validated, and tested on a real-life dataset over eight years. The results indicated that the presented models could effectively predict and forecast the future series values of the removal efficiency of the El-Berka WWTP. The DCB network achieved the highest accuracy as compared to those exhibited by the TF and DFB networks. The RMSE and R-squared for training with the DCB model are 1.95 and 0.90, respectively. The RMSE of DLTSF was 0.85 for forecasting of BOD5. Thus, the DCB and DLTSF models are recommended for evaluating and predicting the performance of WWTP.},

Optimization of coagulant dosage in wastewater treatment is becoming more critical as water quality standards become increasingly stringent. In previous studies, usually build a prediction model only use current water quality parameters that the water quality parameters of previous time sequence were ignored, result in the prediction accuracy is not satisfactory. In this paper, not only current water quality parameters have been taken into account during the modeling, but also historical time-series water quality feature data also considered. For this purpose, a long short term memory (LSTM) model is applied, that is effectively solved the problem of long-term dependencies of recurrent neural network. We collected real sewage treatment plant data for experiments, thorough empirical studies based upon the dataset, and we use R2, RMSE and MAPE as evaluation metrics, experimental result demonstrate that based on LSTM algorithm model can outperform state-of-the-art prediction accuracy compared other algorithm model.},

An excessive dosage of chlorine or, conversely, too small a dosage, may breach existing legal regulations on mandatory limits. Furthermore, excessive amounts generate an unnecessary cost in terms of chlorine and, collaterally, problems due to an increase in the maximum permitted amounts of such by-products as trihalomethanes, which are carcinogenic compounds for humans.

This study examined the effect of pH (5\textendash 12) and alum dosage (30\textendash 180 mg/L) for microalgae Botryococcus sp. harvested via flocculation technique. The optimum pH condition for Botryococcus sp. harvesting was measured to be 9.2, and the alum dosage was 100 mg/L. Both optimum values successfully harvested up to 95\% microalgae biomass. This study revealed that flocculation efficiencies for alum are highly dependent on the range of pH and coagulant dosage that were applied during the process. Use of flocculation technique with alum as a coagulant represents a convenient technique for Botryococcus sp. biomass harvesting and is recommended for use in both small- and large-scale biomass industries.},

In particular, membrane desalination, forward osmosis, energy generation, and biomass treatment have shown substantial potential in modern industries, such as wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and natural products. All these industries consume more than 20\% of total energy consumption in the world. Moreover, the laboratory research outcomes illuminate the way to better membrane design and development, including advanced process control and optimization.

However, the load of food waste to the conventional waste treatment process might lead to the high concentration of total nitrogen (T-N) impact on the effluent water quality. The objective of this study is to establish two machine learning models-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), in order to predict 1-day interval T-N concentration of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in Ulsan, Korea. Daily water quality data and meteorological data were used and the performance of both models was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), relative efficiency criteria (drel). Additionally, Latin-Hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) and a pattern search algorithm were applied to sensitivity analysis and model parameter optimization, respectively. Results showed that both models could be effectively applied to the 1-day interval prediction of T-N concentration of effluent. SVM model showed a higher prediction accuracy in the training stage and similar result in the validation stage. However, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ANN model was a superior model for 1-day interval T-N concentration prediction in terms of the cause-and-effect relationship between T-N concentration and modeling input values to integrated food waste and waste water treatment. This study suggested the efficient and robust nonlinear time-series modeling method for an early prediction of the water quality of integrated food waste and waste water treatment process.},

  abstract = {Water resources of desired quality and quantity are the foundation for human survival and sustainable devel\- opment. To better protect the water environment and conserve water resources, efficient water management, purification, and transportation are of critical importance. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has exhibited its practicability, reliability, and high efficiency in numerous applications; furthermore, it has solved conven\- tional and emerging problems in both natural and engineered water systems. For example, ML can predict various water quality indicators in situ and real-time by considering the complex interactions among waterrelated variables. ML approaches can also solve emerging pollution problems with proven rules or universal mechanisms summarized from the related research. Moreover, by applying image recognition technology to analyze the relationships between image information and physicochemical properties of the research object, ML can effectively identify and characterize specific contaminants. In view of the bright prospects of ML, this review comprehensively summarizes the development of ML applications in natural and engineered water systems. First, the concept and modeling steps of ML are briefly introduced, including data preparation, algorithm selection and model evaluation. In addition, comprehensive applications of ML in recent studies, including predicting water quality, mapping groundwater contaminants, classifying water resources, tracing contaminant sources, and evaluating pollutant toxicity in natural water systems, as well as modeling treatment techniques, assisting characterization analysis, purifying and distributing drinking water, and collecting and treating sewage water in engineered water systems, are summarized. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used al\- gorithms are analyzed according to their structures and mechanisms, and recommendations on the selection of ML algorithms for different studies, as well as prospects on the application and development of ML in water science are proposed. This review provides references for solving a wider range of water-related problems and brings further insights into the intelligent development of water science.},

  abstract = {Cyber physical systems (CPS) are critical to the infrastructure of a country. In addition to being vulnerable to hardware and software failures, and physical attacks, they are now becoming vulnerable to cyber attacks because of their use of off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on World Wide Web, for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network security, he can affect the operations of the system, which may even lead to a catastrophe. Various machine learning, mathematical and formal models try to detect the departure of the system from its expected behaviour. However, little or no work predicts how long the system would take to become unsafe. We here propose a machine learning predictive safety assessment approach that quickly calculates the time to being unsafe (TTBU) of a water-based CPS. We validate our results on a complete replicate of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment facility. Our approach is fast, scalable and robust to noise. The model can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and environment.},

Drivers for this work range from low resource recovery potential and cost effectiveness, to the high energy demands and large environmental footprints of current treatment-plant designs. However, only a few technologies have been implemented and a shift from wastewater treatment plants towards water resource facilities still seems far away. This critical review aims to inform decision-makers in water management utilities about the vast technical possibilities and market supply potentials, as well as the bottlenecks, related to the design or redesign of a municipal wastewater treatment process from a resource recovery perspective. Information and data have been extracted from literature to provide a holistic overview of this growing research field. First, reviewed data is used to calculate the potential of 11 resources recoverable from municipal wastewater treatment plants to supply national resource consumption. Depending on the resource, the supply potential may vary greatly. Second, resource recovery technologies investigated in academia are reviewed comprehensively and critically. The third section of the review identifies nine non-technical bottlenecks mentioned in literature that have to be overcome to successfully implement these technologies into wastewater treatment process designs. The bottlenecks are related to economics and value chain development, environment and health, and society and policy issues. Considering market potentials, technological innovations, and addressing potential bottlenecks early in the planning and process design phase, may facilitate the design and integration of water resource facilities and contribute to more circular urban water management practices.},

  abstract = {Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) discharged in effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), not specifically designed for their removal, pose serious hazards to human health and ecosystems. Their impact is of particular relevance to wastewater disposal and re-use in agricultural settings due to CEC uptake and accumulation in food crops and consequent diffusion into the food-chain. This is the reason why the chemical CEC discussed in this review have been selected considering, besides recalcitrance, frequency of detection and entity of potential hazards, their relevance for crop uptake. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been included as microbial CEC because of the potential of secondary wastewater treatment to offer conditions favourable to the survival and proliferation of ARB, and dissemination of ARGs. Given the adverse effects of chemical and microbial CEC, their removal is being considered as an additional design criterion, which highlights the necessity of upgrading conventional WWTPs with more effective technologies. In this review, the performance of currently applied biological treatment methods for secondary treatment is analysed. To this end, technological solutions including conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactors (MBRs), moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), and nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands (CWs) are compared for the achievable removal efficiencies of the selected CEC and their potential of acting as reservoirs of ARB\&ARGs. With the aim of giving a picture of real systems, this review focuses on data from fullscale and pilot-scale plants treating real urban wastewater. To achieve an integrated assessment, technologies are compared considering also other relevant evaluation parameters such as investment and management costs, complexity of layout and management, present scale of application and need of a post-treatment. Comparison results allow the definition of design and operation strategies for the implementation of CEC removal in WWTPs, when agricultural reuse of effluents is planned.},

This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99\%, 95\%, and 87\% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.},

The two major types are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. It is a challenging task to have real-time, efficient, and accurate hardware RNN implementations because of the high sensitivity to imprecision accumulation and the requirement of special activation function implementations. Recently two works have focused on FPGA implementation of inference phase of LSTM RNNs with model compression. First, ESE uses a weight pruning based compressed RNN model but suffers from irregular network structure after pruning. The second work C-LSTM mitigates the irregular network limitation by incorporating block-circulant matrices for weight matrix representation in RNNs, thereby achieving simultaneous model compression and acceleration.},

  abstract = {To increase prediction accuracy of dissolved oxygen (DO) in aquaculture, a hybrid model based on multi-scale features using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is proposed. Firstly, original DO datasets are decomposed by EEMD and we get several components. Secondly, these components are used to reconstruct four terms including high frequency term, intermediate frequency term, low frequency term and trend term. Thirdly, according to the characteristics of high and intermediate frequency terms, which fluctuate violently, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVR) is used to predict the two terms. The fluctuation of low frequency term is gentle and periodic, so it can be modeled by BP neural network with an optimal mind evolutionary computation (MEC-BP). Then, the trend term is predicted using grey model (GM) because it is nearly linear. Finally, the prediction values of DO datasets are calculated by the sum of the forecasting values of all terms. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid model outperforms EEMD-ELM (extreme learning machine based on EEMD), EEMD-BP and MEC-BP models based on the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Our hybrid model is proven to be an effective approach to predict aquaculture DO.},

In this study, a rainfall-runoff model with deep learning algorithms (CNN-LSTM) was proposed to compute runoff in the watershed based on two-dimensional rainfall radar maps directly. The model explored a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process two-dimensional rainfall maps and long short-term memory (LSTM) to process one-dimensional output data from the CNN and the upstream runoff in order to calculate the flow of the downstream runoff. In addition, the Elbe River basin in Sachsen, Germany, was selected as the study area, and the high-water periods of 2006, 2011, and 2013, and the low-water periods of 2015 and 2018 were used as the study periods. Via the fivefold validation, we found that the Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Kling\textendash Gupta efficiency (KGE) fluctuated from 0.46 to 0.97 and from 0.47 to 0.92 for the high-water period, where the optimal fold achieved 0.97 and 0.92, respectively. For the low-water period, the NSE and KGE ranged from 0.63 to 0.86 and from 0.68 to 0.93, where the optimal fold achieved 0.86 and 0.93, respectively.

AI technology provides technical support for the management and operation of DWT processes, which is more efficient than relying solely on human operations. AI-based data analysis and evolutionary learning mechanisms are capable of realizing water quality diagnosis, autonomous decision making and operation process optimi\- zation and have the potential to establish a universal process analysis and predictive model platform. This review briefly introduces AI technologies that are widely used in DWT. Moreover, this paper reviews in detail the mature applications and latest discoveries of AI and machine learning technologies in the fields of source water quality, coagulation/flocculation, disinfection and membrane filtration, including source water contaminant monitoring and identification, accurate and efficient prediction of coagulation dosage, analysis of the formation of disinfection by-products and advanced control of membrane fouling. Finally, the challenges facing AI tech\- nologies and the issues that need further study are discussed; these challenges can be briefly summarized as a) obtaining more effective characterization data to screen and identify targeted contaminants in the complex background with the assistance of AI technologies and b) establishing a macro intelligence model and decision scheme for entire drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) to support the management of the water supply system.},

The ARIMA and NNAR models both provided acceptable generalization capability with R2s ranged from 0.44 to 0.91 and 0.45 to 0.92, respectively, for chloride and temperature. Although a more prediction performance was observed for NNAR in comparison with ARIMA for all studied series, the forecasting performance of models was further examined using Time Series Cross-Validation (TSCV) and Diebold-Mariano test. The results showed ARIMA is more accurate than NNAR for forecasting the horizon-daily values for CO2, Cl and Ca time-series. Therefore, despite of the good predictive performance of NNAR, ARIMA may still stands as better alternative for forecasting task of aforementioned series. Thus, as a general rule, not only the predictive performance using R2 statistic but also the forecasting performance of a model using TSCV, are need to be examined and compared for selecting an appropriate forecasting model for WTP's influent characteristics.},

The water reuse applications are becoming increasingly a matter of interest in Turkey however it is strongly dependent on following factors: rapid adaptation of urban wastewater reuse programs, the establishment of integrated water resources management framework and guidelines for wastewater reuse programs but on the contrary slow pace of projects, unclear or absence of water quality requirements, the limited commercial development of reclaimed water and lack of public awareness, lack of knowledge about the consequences of untreated or partially treated wastewater discharge into water bodies, difficulties in accepted planning procedures and emerging new technologies in real time scale are the main hurdles in the way of water reclamation and reuse. This paper aims to give an overview of water reuse activities in Turkey and the opportunities and challenges in expanding reclaimed water reuse. This review precisely presents the research trends performed in different institutes to meet the wastewater reuse goal along with the wastewater treatment plants currently working in Turkey.},

  abstract = {A reliable model for any wastewater treatment plant is essential in order to provide a tool for predicting its performance and to form a basis for controlling the operation of the process. This would minimize the operation costs and assess the stability of environmental balance. This process is complex and attains a high degree of nonlinearity due to the presence of bio-organic constituents that are difficult to model using mechanistic approaches. Predicting the plant operational parameters using conventional experimental techniques is also a time consuming step and is an obstacle in the way of efficient control of such processes. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) black-box modeling approach was used to acquire the knowledge base of a real wastewater plant and then used as a process model. The study signifies that the ANNs are capable of capturing the plant operation characteristics with a good degree of accuracy. A computer model is developed that incorporates the trained ANN plant model. The developed program is implemented and validated using plant-scale data obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant, namely the Doha West wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). It is used as a valuable performance assessment tool for plant operators and decision makers. The ANN model provided accurate predictions of the effluent stream, in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) when using COD as an input in the crude supply stream. It can be said that the ANN predictions based on three crude supply inputs together, namely BOD, COD and TSS, resulted in better ANN predictions when using only one crude supply input. Graphical user interface representation of the ANN for the Doha West WWTP data is performed and presented. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Among a various range of biosensors, optical biosensors, in particular, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), have brought new advantages like real-time and label-free detection with higher levels of sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. Considering environmental hazards endangering human health and applications of SPR in environmental monitoring, SPR has indicated great promise, especially in detecting environmental hazards with low molecular weights in complex matrices. Apart from the all as-mentioned positives, there exist some relevant concerns such as data processing, sensor reliability and accuracy, and poor signal-to-noise ratios, all of which can be improved using machine learning (ML) approaches. ML can evaluate large data, produce appropriate results, even from noisy and low-resolution sensing data, and find interrelationships between signals and bioevents. In this chapter, SPR principles and its use for environmental monitoring will be discussed. Finally, different ML algorithms and their applications in different SPR sensors are aimed to be reviewed.},

In the following, the efficacy of 13 different water remediation methods (coagulation, filtration, bioreactors, and ultraviolet-based methods) to treat fourteen types of wastewater derived from fruit and vegetable processing (fruit, root vegetables, leafy greens) were examined. Each treatment was assessed in terms of reducing suspended solids, total phosphorus, nitrogen, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. From the data generated, it was possible to develop predictive modeling for each of the water treatments tested. Models to predict post-treatment water quality were studied and developed using multiple linear regression (coefficient of determination (R2) of 30 to 83\%), which were improved by the generalized structure of group method of data handling models (R2 of 73\textendash 99\%). The selection of multiple linear regression and the generalized structure of group method of data handling models was due to the ability of the models to produce robust equations for ease of use and practicality. The large variability and complex nature of wastewater quality parameters were challenging to represent in linear models; however, they were better suited for group method of data handling technique as shown in the study. The model provides an important tool to end users in selecting the appropriate treatment based on the original wastewater characteristics and required standards for the treated water.},

Industrial countries, where financial resources are available but restricted, face difficulties in some cases related to the lack of a complete definition of irrigation water quality standards, as well as to the lack of monitoring components that determine if the effluent is suitable for such use. The present paper presents a critical review on urban reclamation technologies for irrigation. The technologies are presented by the four most important parameters for irrigation water quality: salinity, pathogens, nutrients and heavy metals.

  abstract = {Real-time water quality monitoring is a complex system as it involves many quality parameters to be monitored, the nature of these parameters, and non-linear interdependence between themselves. Intelligent algorithms crucial in building intelligent systems are good candidates for building a reliable and convenient monitoring system. To analyze water quality, we need to understand, model, and monitor the water pollution in real time using different online water quality sensors through an Internet of things framework. However, many water quality parameters cannot be easily measured online due to several reasons such as high-cost sensors, low sampling rate, multiple processing stages by few heterogeneous sensors, the requirement of frequent cleaning and calibration, and spatial and application dependency among different water bodies. A soft sensor is an efficient and convenient alternative approach for water quality monitoring. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based soft sensor model to estimate biological oxygen demand (BOD), a time-consuming and challenging process to measure. We also propose a system architecture for implementing the soft sensor both on the cloud and edge layers, so that the edge device can make adaptive decisions in real time by monitoring the quality of water. A comparative study between the computational performance of edge and cloud nodes in terms of prediction accuracy, learning time, and decision time for different machine learning (ML) algorithms is also presented. This paper establishes that BOD soft sensors are efficient, less costly, and reasonably accurate with an example of a real-life application. Here, the IBK ML technique proves to be the most efficient in predicting BOD. The experimental setup uses 100 test readings of STP water samples to evaluate the performance of the IBK technique, and the statistical measures are reported as correlation coefficient = 0.9273, MAE = 0.082, RMSE = 0.1994, RAE = 17.20\%, RRSE = 37.62\%, and edge response time = 0.15 s only.},

  abstract = {Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) are facilities devoted to managing and reducing the pollutant concentrations present in the urban residual waters. Some of them consist in nitrogen and phosphorus derived products which are harmful for the environment. Consequently, certain constraints are applied to pollutant concentrations in order to make sure that treated waters comply with the established regulations. In that sense, efforts have been applied to the development of control strategies that help in the pollutant reduction tasks. Furthermore, the appearance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has encouraged the adoption of predictive control strategies. In such a fashion, this work is mainly focused on the adoption and development of them to actuate over the pollutant concentrations only when predictions of effluents determine that violations will be produced. In that manner, the overall WWTP's operational costs can be reduced. Predictions are generated by means of an ANN-based Soft-Sensor which adopts Long-Short Term Memory cells to predict effluent pollutant levels. These are the ammonium ( S-\{NH,e\} ) and the total nitrogen ( S-\{Ntot,e\} ) which are predicted considering influent parameters such as the ammonium concentration at the entrance of the WWTP reactor tanks ( S-\{NH,po\} ), the reactors' input flow rate ( Q-\{po\} ), the WWTP recirculation rate ( Q-\{a\} ) and the environmental temperature ( T-\{as\} ). Moreover, this work presents a new multi-objective control scenario which consists in a unique control structure performing the reduction of S-\{NH,e\} and S-\{Ntot,e\} concentrations simultaneously. Performance of this new control approach is contrasted with other strategies to determine the improvement provided by the ANN-based Soft-Sensor as well as by the fact of being controlling two pollutants at the same time. Results show that some brief and small violations are still produced. Nevertheless, an improvement in the WWTPs performance w.r.t.The most common control strategies around 96.58\% and 98.31\% is achieved for S-\{NH,e\} and S-\{Ntot,e\} , respectively.},

The Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) is used for evaluation, and the control is based on Model Predicitive Control (MPC) and fuzzy logic. To improve effluent quality and to reduce operational costs, a hierarchical control structure is implemented to regulate the dissolved oxygen (DO) on the three aerated tanks. The high level of this hierarchical structure is developed with a fuzzy controller that adapts the DO set points of the low level based on the NH concentration in the fifth tank (NH5). The low level is composed of three MPC controllers with feedforward control (MPC + FF). For avoiding violations of Ntot,e, a second fuzzy controller is used to manipulate the external carbon flow rate in the first tank (qEC1) based on nitrate nitrogen in the fifth tank (NO5) plus NH5. For avoiding violations of NHe, a third fuzzy controller is applied to manipulate the internal recirculation flow rate (Qrin) based on NH5 and NH in the influent. Simulation results show the benefit of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Until 2016 power plants within the EU will have to meet new limits on emissions as dictated by EU regulations. One of the major challenges is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) due to health and ozone-formation concerns. Combustion optimisation is one of the primary measures for reducing NOx emissions from boilers burning coal, oil, or natural gas. The optimisation can be achieved by excess air control, boiler fine tuning and balancing the fuel and air flow to the various burners in order to reach minimum NOx formation.In this paper, a multi-step-ahead prediction of NOx emissions that can provide a basis for on-line control is presented. About 9. days' worth of real data were acquired from an operator of a coal-based power plant for this study. It begins with a presentation of measured variables, pre-processing of the data and a definition of performance measures. Feature selection analysis follows, identifying the variables important for multi-step NOx prediction. In this respect, the impact of primary variables that are directly related to the combustion process is compared against that of other variables important in boiler operation and some transformed variables. Based on optimal features, a model comparison study including linear (ARX and ARMAX) and nonlinear (NN and SVR) modelling approaches is presented. Results of the model comparison study reveal that for the analysed boiler, nonlinear models do not improve the robust prediction performance of a linear ARX model. In the last part of the paper, an adaptive modelling approach further investigates the potential improvements in NOx prediction. A comparison of static and adaptive versions of the linear ARX model reveals that the adaptive approach does not improve prediction performance significantly. Hence the static ARX model in combination with an optimally selected set of input variables and extracted features is recommended for the multi-step NOx prediction of the coal-based boiler. \textcopyright{} 2012.},

While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts {$>$} 1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of {$>$} 1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events. Furthermore, we find that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost due to its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data.},

In this regard, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have found to be advantageous to predict the uncertain performances of the treatment processes. MLAs have shown satisfactory results for effective real-time monitoring, optimization, prediction of uncertainties and fault detection of complex environmental systems. By incorporating these algorithms with online sensors, the transient operating conditions during the treatment process including disruptions or failures due to leaking pipelines, malfunctioning of bioreactors, unexpected fluctuations of organic loadings, flow rate, and temperature can be forecasted efficiently. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art MLA approaches for the integrated operation of biological wastewater treatment systems combining algal biomass production and nutrient recovery from municipal wastewater.},

  abstract = {Big Data and machine learning (ML) technologies have the potential to impact many facets of environment and water management (EWM). Big Data are information assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Fast advances in high-resolution remote sensing techniques, smart information and communication technologies, and social media have contributed to the proliferation of Big Data in many EWM fields, such as weather forecasting, disaster management, smart water and energy management systems, and remote sensing. Big Data brings about new opportunities for data-driven discovery in EWM, but it also requires new forms of information processing, storage, retrieval, as well as analytics. ML, a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI), refers broadly to computer algorithms that can automatically learn from data. ML may help unlock the power of Big Data if properly integrated with data analytics. Recent breakthroughs in AI and computing infrastructure have led to the fast development of powerful deep learning (DL) algorithms that can extract hierarchical features from data, with better predictive performance and less human intervention. Collectively Big Data and ML techniques have shown great potential for data-driven decision making, scientific discovery, and process optimization. These technological advances may greatly benefit EWM, especially because (1) many EWM applications (e.g. early flood warning) require the capability to extract useful information from a large amount of data in autonomous manner and in real time, (2) EWM researches have become highly multidisciplinary, and handling the ever increasing data volume/types using the traditional workflow is simply not an option, and last but not least, (3) the current theoretical knowledge about many EWM processes is still incomplete, but which may now be complemented through data-driven discovery. A large number of applications on Big Data and ML have already appeared in the EWM literature in recent years. The purposes of this survey are to (1) examine the potential and benefits of data-driven research in EWM, (2) give a synopsis of key concepts and approaches in Big Data and ML, (3) provide a systematic review of current applications, and finally (4) discuss major issues and challenges, and recommend future research directions. EWM includes a broad range of research topics. Instead of attempting to survey each individual area, this review focuses on areas of nexus in EWM, with an emphasis on elucidating the potential benefits of increased data availability and predictive analytics to improving the EWM research.},

AI allows for cost-effective operation of systems, including better planning and tracking as well as comprehensive understanding of resource-loss in realtime, then maximizing revenue capture and water quality satisfaction. This study therefore aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current application of AI-based tools in simulating membrane processes as well as the feasibility of applying these models to other fields in which membranes are to be used in the future. The existing conventional mathematical models are illustrated along with their advantages and shortcomings. The definition and classification of state-of-the-art AI models, as well as the benefits of these over conventional models, are also discussed. Furthermore, the basic principle of membrane processes and current application of AI-based technologies in simulating the performance of these membrane systems are systematically reviewed.

Optimizing this process poses certain challenges, as the objectives of reaching the required disinfection effect and limiting the formation of disinfection by-products must be met simultaneously. These need adjusting the chlorine dosage in real time to cope with fluctuations in water quality and maintaining a free chlorine residual at the clear-water reservoir outlet that does not exceed regulatory limits. This paper proposes a composite control scheme that combines disturbance observer (DOB) and model predictive control (MPC) to meet the aforementioned objectives. MPC is employed for the feedback control of post-chlorine dosage, and DOB is adapted to monitor fluctuations in influent water quality. The estimated value from the DOB is applied in the feed-forward control of post-chlorine dosage. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DOB-MPC composite control scheme provides a better disturbance rejection effect against fluctuations in influent water quality than MPC-only and PID-only control schemes, and it can effectively stabilize the quality of treated water.},

The purpose of this study is to obtain a modelling approach which is able to identify the nonlinearity of influent and explain the correlation of inputs-outputs. Thus, the variation of influent characteristics was investigated at the first stage, which provided the basis to build global and local multiple linear regression models. Secondly, a nonlinear modelling tool multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) was applied for influent COD and TP prediction. Satisfactory prediction accuracy was obtained in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R2. Unlike other machine learning techniques which are ``black box'' models, MARS provided interpretable models which explained the nonlinearity and correlation of inputs-outputs. The MARS models can be used not only for prediction, but also to provide insight of influent variation.},

These tools were used to estimate chemical dosage at a daily time-scale. Influent water quality such as pH, color, turbidity, and alkalinity, as well as chemical dosage including sulfuric acid, ferric sulfate and liquid oxygen were used to build and test these models. An 80/20 percent data split was used for training and testing model performance using correlation coefficients, relative mean square error, relative root mean square error and Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency.

This control objective is difficult to achieve by the conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) feedback controls or manual control because of the complicated dynamics of the chlorination process. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for chlorine dosing, in which FCR can be predicted by the support vector machine (SVM) model. Both of the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed MPC scheme has better control performance than the conventional PID feedback control scheme because of the SVM predictions being accurate and the MPC outperforming the PID, and that it can effectively stabilize the quality of treated water.},

It is well-established that activated sludge can form granules under certain environmental conditions such as batch-wise operation with feast-famine feeding, high hydrodynamic shear forces, and short settling time which select for dense microbial aggregates. Aerobic granules with stable structure and functionality have been obtained with a range of different wastewaters seeded with different sources of sludge at different operational conditions, but the microbial communities developed differed substantially. In spite of this, granule instability occurs. In this review, the available literature on the mechanisms involved in granulation and how it affects the effluent quality is assessed with special attention given to the microbial interactions involved. To be able to optimize the process further, more knowledge is needed regarding the influence of microbial communities and their metabolism on granule stability and functionality.

Traditional water quality monitoring for a variety of water parameters requires the placement of multiple sensors, and some water quality data (e.g., total nitrogen (TN)) requires testing instruments or laboratory analysis to obtain results, which takes longer than the sensors. In this paper, we designed a water quality prediction framework, which uses available water quality variables (e.g., temperature, pH, conductivity, etc.) to predict total nitrogen concentrations in inland water bodies. The framework was also used to predict nearshore seawater salinity and temperature using remote sensing bands. We conducted experiments on real water quality datasets and random forest was chosen to be the core algorithm of the framework by comparing and analyzing the performance of different machine learning algorithms. The results show that among all tested machine learning models, random forest performs the best. The data prediction error rate of the random forest model in predicting the total nitrogen concentration in inland rivers was 4.9\%. Moreover, to explore the prediction effect of random forest algorithm when the independent variable is non-water quality data, we took the reflectance of remote sensing bands as the independent variables and successfully inverted the salinity distribution of Shenzhen Bay in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. According to the experimental results, the random forest-based water quality prediction framework can achieve 92.94\% accuracy in predicting the salinity of nearshore waters.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in water supply system is important to ensure safety of drinking water. Yet it is a laborious job. Developing predictive DBPs models using simple and easy parameters is a promising way. Yet current models could not be well applied into practice because of the improper dataset (e.g. not from real tap water) they used or involving the parameters that are difficult to measure or require expensive instruments. In this study, four simple and easy water quality parameters (temperature, pH, UVA254 and Cl2) were used to predict trihalomethane (THMs) occurrence in tap water. Linear/log linear regression models (LRM) and radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF ANN) were adopted to develop the THMs models. 64 observations from tap water samples were used to develop and test models. Results showed that only one or two parameters entered LRMs, and their prediction ability was very limited (testing datasets: N25 = 46\textendash 69\%, rp = 0.334\textendash 0.459). Different from LRM, the prediction accuracy of RBF ANNs developed with pH, temperature, UVA254 and Cl2 can be improved continuously by tweaking the maximum number of neuron (MN) and Gaussian function spread (S) until it reached best. The optimum RBF ANNs of T-THMs, TCM and BDCM were obtained when setting MN = 20, S = 100, 100.1 and 60, respectively, where the N25 and rp values for testing datasets reached 85\textendash 92\% and 0.813\textendash 0.886, respectively. Accurate predictions of THMs by RBF ANNs with these four simple and easy parameters paved an economic and convenient way for THMs monitoring in real water supply system.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models provide an adaptive tool to predict the performance of treatment reactors under varying operational and influent conditions. Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is still an emerging technology and does not have a long history of full-scale application. There is, therefore, a scarcity of long-term data in this field, which impacted the development of data-driven models. In this study, a machine learning model was developed for simulating the AGS process using 475 days of data collected from three lab-based reactors. Inputs were selected based on RReliefF ranking after multicollinearity reduction. A five-stage model structure was adopted in which each parameter was predicted using separate models for the preceding parameters as inputs. An ensemble of artificial neural networks, support vector regression and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems was used to improve the models' performance. The developed model was able to predict the MLSS, MLVSS, SVI5, SVI30, granule size, and effluent COD, NH4-N, and PO43- with average R2, nRMSE and sMAPE of 95.7\%, 0.032 and 3.7\% respectively.},

  abstract = {Two machine learning methods, support vector machine and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) were investigated in this paper to predict the coagulant dosage in water treatment plants (WTPs). Two types of support vector machine regression techniques, e-SVR and v-SVR, using two different kernel functions (radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial function), and KNN were investigated in order to predict coagulant dosage in a large, a medium, and two small-sized WTPs. The results show that these two types of support vector machine regression techniques have good predictive capabilities for the large and medium WTPs as compared to small water systems. The performances of e-SVR with RBF kernel function were compared with that obtained from the KNN algorithm (as baseline) for four WTPs. The comparison shows that the KNN has similar performances as e-SVR for the large and mediumsized WTPs and performs better for two small-sized WTPs. The results show that different machine learning methods have competing predictive abilities.},

  abstract = {Demand for water is expanding with increases in population, particularly in urban areas in developing countries. Additionally, urban water system needs a novel perspective for upgradation with urbanization. This perspective presents a novel 5R approach for managing urban water resources: Recover (storm water), Reduce (toilet flushing water), Recycle (gray water), Resource (black water), and Reuse (advanced-treated wastewater). The 5R generation incorporates the latest ideas for harvesting storm water, gray water, and black water in its several forms. This paper has briefly demonstrated each R of 5R generation for water treatment and reuse. China has the chance to upgrade its urban water systems according to 5R principles. Already, a demonstration project of 5R generation has been installed in Qingdao International Horticultural Exposition, and Dalian International Convention Center (China) has applied 5R, achieving over 70\% water saving. The 5R offers promise for moving solutions for urban water scarcity from ``hoped for in the future'' to ``realistic today''.},
