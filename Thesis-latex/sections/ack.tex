I would first express my enormous gratitude to my thesis supervisor Prof. Chii Shang for giving me the opportunity to start my MPhil degree in this research group. I was given chances to be exposed to different research topics and work with other brilliant students; most importantly, I have learned so much from his mentoring in research and life. He also encouraged me to develop the research area I am interested in. I sincerely appreciate his guidance in the last two years.

I appreciate Prof. Guanghao CHEN and Prof. Yuhsing WANG for serving on my thesis examination committee. Special thanks should go to Dr. Ran YIN for giving critical advice on my research. Dr. YIN has guided me throughout my master's degree and led me to work on a new research area.

I thank my fellow labmates in Prof. SHANG's group: Oriana JOVANOVIC, Gabriela CASSOL, Jing ZHAO, and Tao LI, for their support and help. Also, I thank my friends in HKUST: Yude PEI, Yugo SATO, and Kaleong CHENG for their additional help with my research.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family for their love, support, and continuous encouragement.
