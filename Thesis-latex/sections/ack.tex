First of all, I am truly grateful for being one of the first PhD students supervised by Prof. Li.
He was full of passion and patience when helping me build the know-how for this degree. It has been a great pleasure for me to be part of this team and grow together with the lab during the last four years. Furthermore, I would like to thank all of the members of the thesis examination committee for their careful examination of my thesis.

Finally, I would not stand at this current point without their endless love and unconditional support for all these years.
