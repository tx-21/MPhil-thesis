\section{Data collection and preparation}
Most AI techniques were modeled using experimental data to simulate, predict confirm, and optimize contaminant removal in wastewater treatment processes. Experimental data set were either divided into three parts (training, validation, and testing) or two parts (training and testing). The training set was used to develop the model, the validation data set was used to optimize the model, and the testing data set was used to test the model in the prediction stage.

\subsection{Metrics for model evaluation}
AI methods have been demonstrated to be effective in controlling chlorination, while ML models are effective in modeling DBP concentrations, as well as modeling important parameters for adsorption and membrane-filtration processes. The results are often evaluated using various statistical measures including the coefficient of correlation (R), the coefficient of determination (R2), the mean average error (MAE), the mean square error (MSE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative error (RE).
