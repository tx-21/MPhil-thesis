\subsection{Machine learning vs deep learning}
RF is used in this work as a representative tree-based modeling strategy because RF models have some major advantages over alternative tree-based models; notably, they require fewer hyperparameters for tuning, their performance is robust to hyperparameter changes, and they are less likely to suffer from overfitting (Breiman, 2001;Breiman, 2002 ;Chen and Guestrin, 2016;Fawagreh et al., 2014 ;Ke et al., 2017).
