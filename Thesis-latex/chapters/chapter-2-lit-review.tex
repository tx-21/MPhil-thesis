\subsection{Decision-making processes for water quality control}

In this study the new control objectives for the reclaimed water system in 
Shek Wu Hui Effluent Polish Plant have been established: to monitor color 
and ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent and at the same time provide 
a predictive model to assist the disinfection control strategy for disinfecting 
the MBR effluent to meet the endorsed reclaimed water standard.
