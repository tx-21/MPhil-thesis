\section{Water reclamation in WWTPs}
\subsection{Reclaimed water for urban water crisis}
%Describe the issue of urban water crisis
%%Statistics from UN or NGOs
%%Comments from some review papers
%%Reports that talk or project HK is also a city with urban water crisis
%Explain the solutions to address urban water crisis
%%The four solutions mentioned by Exall
To address urban water crisis, there are four primary solutions which are rainwater 
harvesting, stormwater runoff, onsite groundwater, and reclaimed water. \cite{exall_integrated_2012}
%%potable and non-potable water uses
%%Talk about the pros of using reclaimation specifically in urban cities, back-up my saying by making HK as an example
%The efforts have been made for generating reclaimed water
%%Use big cities from papers to make good examples to express we need to focus on using reclaimed water

\subsection{Decision-making processes for water quality control}
%Describe the need of using decision-making processes for water quality
%Using examples to show how the decision-making process can benefit water quality control

In this study the new control objectives for the reclaimed water system in 
Shek Wu Hui Effluent Polish Plant have been established: to monitor color 
and ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent and at the same time provide 
a predictive model to assist the disinfection control strategy for disinfecting 
the MBR effluent to meet the endorsed reclaimed water standard.


\subsection{The use of machine learning in model predictive control}
%Describe how mahcine learning become a dominent role or telling people using ml is a trend
%Make exampling of how machine learning really benefit water quality control

\section{Introduction to Deep Learning (DL)}
\subsection{Deep Learning in water quality forecasting}
%why DL is better than ML?

\subsection{Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)}
%why we need to use this?

\section{Environments for developing deep learning models}
\subsection{The use of Python programming languages}
%why python? compared to matlab

\subsection{Build forecasting models with deep learning frameworks}
%what are the frameworks, and why using them
