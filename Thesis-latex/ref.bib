	abstract = {In this paper the following new control objectives for biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been established: to eliminate violations of total nitrogen in the eﬄuent (Ntot,e) or ammonium and ammonia nitrogen concentration (NH) in the eﬄuent (NHe) and at the same time handle the customary requirements of improving eﬄuent quality and reducing operational costs. The Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) is used for evaluation, and the control is based on Model Predicitive Control (MPC) and fuzzy logic. To improve eﬄuent quality and to reduce operational costs, a hierarchical control structure is implemented to regulate the dissolved oxygen (DO) on the three aerated tanks. The high level of this hierarchical structure is developed with a fuzzy controller that adapts the DO set points of the low level based on the NH concentration in the ﬁfth tank (NH5). The low level is composed of three MPC controllers with feedforward control (MPC + FF). For avoiding violations of Ntot,e, a second fuzzy controller is used to manipulate the external carbon ﬂow rate in the ﬁrst tank (qEC1) based on nitrate nitrogen in the ﬁfth tank (NO5) plus NH5. For avoiding violations of NHe, a third fuzzy controller is applied to manipulate the internal recirculation ﬂow rate (Qrin) based on NH5 and NH in the inﬂuent. Simulation results show the beneﬁt of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Wastewater reclamation may produce many advantages including increased water conservation, better environmental protection, and attractive economic beneﬁts. This will be deemed critical in south Taiwan where the heavy industries are concentrated but existing water resources are unable to meet the increasing demands for water supply. One particular wastewater reuse option is aquifer recharge using treated efﬂuents that may alleviate land subsidence issue and seawater intrusion caused by unregulated aquaculture practices in the coastal region around this area. Yet wide variations of nutrient contents in treated efﬂuents may make the implementation process of wastewater reclamation more sensitive. This paper presents a novel approach on the basis of a neural network model that is designed to provide better predictions of nitrogen contents in treated efﬂuents to be used for groundwater recharge. The optimal structure of a neural network model useful for evaluating the reuse potential of the efﬂuent produced from a contact-aeration process is developed. The importance of using oxidation/reduction potential readings as an input in the model to predict the degree of nitriﬁcation achieved is demonstrated. To enhance cost effectiveness in wastewater reclamation, a rainfall index is taken into account as a useful input in the model that provides the ﬂexibility needed in decision-making process in accordance with the weather conditions observed. Research ﬁndings indicate that a well-trained neural network model is helpful in the assessment of wastewater reclamation practice to achieve signiﬁcant cost savings with modest efforts in on-line sampling and analysis.},

	abstract = {Many regions of the world face great challenges in continuing to meet basic needs for drinking water and sanitation for growing urban populations, while depending on increasingly variable, stressed and degraded water sources. Integrated urban water management (IUWM) is an approach developed as a means of managing all sources of water within an urban setting to meet urban water needs. This chapter begins with a description of patterns of urban water use and an explanation of IUWM and water reuse concepts. The following sections describe key aspects of water quality, water treatment technologies and infrastructure, particularly as they relate to rainwater or stormwater harvesting and water reuse. Finally, sustainability challenges and future trends in IUWM and water reuse are brieﬂy described and sources of further information are provided.},
