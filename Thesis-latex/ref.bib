	abstract = {Because of its robust autonomous learning and ability to address complex problems, artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly demonstrated its potential to solve the challenges faced in drinking water treatment (DWT). AI technology provides technical support for the management and operation of DWT processes, which is more efficient than relying solely on human operations. AI-based data analysis and evolutionary learning mechanisms are capable of realizing water quality diagnosis, autonomous decision making and operation process optimi­ zation and have the potential to establish a universal process analysis and predictive model platform. This review briefly introduces AI technologies that are widely used in DWT. Moreover, this paper reviews in detail the mature applications and latest discoveries of AI and machine learning technologies in the fields of source water quality, coagulation/flocculation, disinfection and membrane filtration, including source water contaminant monitoring and identification, accurate and efficient prediction of coagulation dosage, analysis of the formation of disinfection by-products and advanced control of membrane fouling. Finally, the challenges facing AI tech­ nologies and the issues that need further study are discussed; these challenges can be briefly summarized as a) obtaining more effective characterization data to screen and identify targeted contaminants in the complex background with the assistance of AI technologies and b) establishing a macro intelligence model and decision scheme for entire drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) to support the management of the water supply system.},

	abstract = {Chlorine is the most common disinfectant used in drinking water treatment. To meet the desired disinfection level and restrict the formation of harmful disinfectant by-products, the chlorine dosage should be adjusted in real time to cope with the varying influent water quality and to ensure that the free chlorine residual (FCR) of the clear-water reservoir outlet is within the prescribed limits. This control objective is difficult to achieve by the conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) feedback controls or manual control because of the complicated dynamics of the chlorination process. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for chlorine dosing, in which FCR can be predicted by the support vector machine (SVM) model. Both of the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed MPC scheme has better control performance than the conventional PID feedback control scheme because of the SVM predictions being accurate and the MPC outperforming the PID, and that it can effectively stabilize the quality of treated water.},

	abstract = {Expectation of wastewater quality in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is significant and can decrease the sampling number, cost, decision time, and energy. This paper presents two methods for predicting and fore­ casting the removal efficiency of total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological ox­ ygen demand (BOD5), ammonia, and sulphide at El-Berka wastewater treatment plant, Egypt. The first method uses different prediction models, includes the use of traditional feed-forward (TF), deep feed-forward back­ propagation (DFB), and deep cascade-forward backpropagation (DCB) networks. The TF was generated in three layers: input, hidden, and an output layer. The DFB network comprised of six layers: an input, four hidden, and an output layer. The DCB network was created with six layers (with skip connections): an input, four hidden, and an output layer. The other method is a forecasting model by using deep learning time series forecasting (DLTSF) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The developed models were trained, validated, and tested on a real-life dataset over eight years. The results indicated that the presented models could effectively predict and forecast the future series values of the removal efficiency of the El-Berka WWTP. The DCB network achieved the highest accuracy as compared to those exhibited by the TF and DFB networks. The RMSE and R-squared for training with the DCB model are 1.95 and 0.90, respectively. The RMSE of DLTSF was 0.85 for forecasting of BOD5. Thus, the DCB and DLTSF models are recommended for evaluating and predicting the performance of WWTP.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) problem of nitrogen removal process in the wastewater treatment plants. The main objective of this paper is to design an event-triggered control strategy such that the computation burden can be reduced effectively while maintaining the desired system performance. Unlike existing model predictive control (MPC), the controller in the proposed ETMPC takes action when certain event conditions are satisfied, and thus can reduce the communication and computation resource caused by continuous controller update. The triggering condition is designed according to the system output error and the prediction step of the MPC controller, and thus is easy to check. Moreover, a state space model of the studied nitrogen removal process is built, based on which the ETMPC is designed. The controller is developed to maintain the tracking performance of the dissolved oxygen concentration and nitrate nitrogen concentration by adjusting two key variables in the WWTPs. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system under the designed control strategy is conducted by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Some simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the number of controller update by up to 60\% compared with MPC, whereas the ISE only increases by about 0.1, which is acceptable for WWTPs.},

This study investigates the application of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the inﬂuent BOD5 concentration and the performance of WWTPs. The WWTP performance was deﬁned in terms of the COD, BOD, and TSS concentrations in the efﬂuent. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the best-performing ANN network structure and conﬁguration. The results showed that the ANN model developed to predict the BOD concentration performed the best among the three outputs. The topperforming ANN models yielded R2 values of 0.752, 0.612, and 0.631 for the prediction of the BOD, COD, and TSS concentrations, respectively. The optimal performing models were obtained (three inputs – one output), which indicated that the inﬂuent temperature and conductivity greatly affect the WWTP performance as inputs in all models. The developed prediction model for the inﬂuent BOD5 concentration attained a high accuracy, i.e., R2 ¼ 0.754, which implies that the model is viable as a soft sensor for online control and management systems for WWTPs. Overall, the ANN model provides a simple approach for the prediction of the complex processes of WWTPs.},

Water resources in Jordan comprise of conventional resources (ground water and surface water) and non-conventional resources mainly treated wastewater. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to provide predictions for the quality of treated effluent from Wadi Arab wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)-Phase1. This plant serves South-West of Irbid city. The treated effluent of Wadi Arab WWTP is used for irrigation. Four ANN models were developed to predict effluent quality of Wadi Arab WWTP-Phase1, namely BOD5, COD, SS, NH4-N. A systematic approach was employed to find the most appropriate architecture for each ANN model. The influent flow rate (Q), Temperature, pH, BOD5, COD, SS and NH4-N were the input quality parameters for each ANN model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to uncover the prediction uncertainty of an ANN model to variations in each input parameter. The analyses showed that all four ANN models were highly sensitive to influent pH,while all were slightly sensitive to influent SS. This study found that ANN models were reasonably robust and they could be used to alert plant staff of future problems such as those indicated in the above scenarios. The results showed that ANN models are beneficial to manage the treatment process in Wadi Arab WWTP, to produce effluent quality within the Jordanian Standards for irrigation, and to protect the ecosystem in the Jordan Valley.},

	abstract = {Wastewater reclamation may produce many advantages including increased water conservation, better environmental protection, and attractive economic beneﬁts. This will be deemed critical in south Taiwan where the heavy industries are concentrated but existing water resources are unable to meet the increasing demands for water supply. One particular wastewater reuse option is aquifer recharge using treated efﬂuents that may alleviate land subsidence issue and seawater intrusion caused by unregulated aquaculture practices in the coastal region around this area. Yet wide variations of nutrient contents in treated efﬂuents may make the implementation process of wastewater reclamation more sensitive. This paper presents a novel approach on the basis of a neural network model that is designed to provide better predictions of nitrogen contents in treated efﬂuents to be used for groundwater recharge. The optimal structure of a neural network model useful for evaluating the reuse potential of the efﬂuent produced from a contact-aeration process is developed. The importance of using oxidation/reduction potential readings as an input in the model to predict the degree of nitriﬁcation achieved is demonstrated. To enhance cost effectiveness in wastewater reclamation, a rainfall index is taken into account as a useful input in the model that provides the ﬂexibility needed in decision-making process in accordance with the weather conditions observed. Research ﬁndings indicate that a well-trained neural network model is helpful in the assessment of wastewater reclamation practice to achieve signiﬁcant cost savings with modest efforts in on-line sampling and analysis.},

The Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) is used for evaluation, and the control is based on Model Predicitive Control (MPC) and fuzzy logic. To improve eﬄuent quality and to reduce operational costs, a hierarchical control structure is implemented to regulate the dissolved oxygen (DO) on the three aerated tanks. The high level of this hierarchical structure is developed with a fuzzy controller that adapts the DO set points of the low level based on the NH concentration in the ﬁfth tank (NH5). The low level is composed of three MPC controllers with feedforward control (MPC + FF). For avoiding violations of Ntot,e, a second fuzzy controller is used to manipulate the external carbon ﬂow rate in the ﬁrst tank (qEC1) based on nitrate nitrogen in the ﬁfth tank (NO5) plus NH5. For avoiding violations of NHe, a third fuzzy controller is applied to manipulate the internal recirculation ﬂow rate (Qrin) based on NH5 and NH in the inﬂuent. Simulation results show the beneﬁt of the proposed approach.},
