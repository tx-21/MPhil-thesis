	abstract = {Numerous deep learning architectures have been developed to accommodate the diversity of time series datasets across different domains. In this article, we survey common encoder and decoder designs used in both one-step-ahead and multi-horizon time series forecasting -- describing how temporal information is incorporated into predictions by each model. Next, we highlight recent developments in hybrid deep learning models, which combine well-studied statistical models with neural network components to improve pure methods in either category. Lastly, we outline some ways in which deep learning can also facilitate decision support with time series data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to time series forecasting. Time series data are prevalent in many scientiﬁc and engineering disciplines. Time series forecasting is a crucial task in modeling time series data, and is an important area of machine learning. In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast time series data. This approach works by leveraging selfattention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series data. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings. Using inﬂuenzalike illness (ILI) forecasting as a case study, we show that the forecasting results produced by our approach are favorably comparable to the stateof-the-art.},

	abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models that do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attention-based architecture that combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and highlight three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.},

	abstract = {In this paper the following new control objectives for biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been established: to eliminate violations of total nitrogen in the eﬄuent (Ntot,e) or ammonium and ammonia nitrogen concentration (NH) in the eﬄuent (NHe) and at the same time handle the customary requirements of improving eﬄuent quality and reducing operational costs. The Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) is used for evaluation, and the control is based on Model Predicitive Control (MPC) and fuzzy logic. To improve eﬄuent quality and to reduce operational costs, a hierarchical control structure is implemented to regulate the dissolved oxygen (DO) on the three aerated tanks. The high level of this hierarchical structure is developed with a fuzzy controller that adapts the DO set points of the low level based on the NH concentration in the ﬁfth tank (NH5). The low level is composed of three MPC controllers with feedforward control (MPC + FF). For avoiding violations of Ntot,e, a second fuzzy controller is used to manipulate the external carbon ﬂow rate in the ﬁrst tank (qEC1) based on nitrate nitrogen in the ﬁfth tank (NO5) plus NH5. For avoiding violations of NHe, a third fuzzy controller is applied to manipulate the internal recirculation ﬂow rate (Qrin) based on NH5 and NH in the inﬂuent. Simulation results show the beneﬁt of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Wastewater reclamation may produce many advantages including increased water conservation, better environmental protection, and attractive economic beneﬁts. This will be deemed critical in south Taiwan where the heavy industries are concentrated but existing water resources are unable to meet the increasing demands for water supply. One particular wastewater reuse option is aquifer recharge using treated efﬂuents that may alleviate land subsidence issue and seawater intrusion caused by unregulated aquaculture practices in the coastal region around this area. Yet wide variations of nutrient contents in treated efﬂuents may make the implementation process of wastewater reclamation more sensitive. This paper presents a novel approach on the basis of a neural network model that is designed to provide better predictions of nitrogen contents in treated efﬂuents to be used for groundwater recharge. The optimal structure of a neural network model useful for evaluating the reuse potential of the efﬂuent produced from a contact-aeration process is developed. The importance of using oxidation/reduction potential readings as an input in the model to predict the degree of nitriﬁcation achieved is demonstrated. To enhance cost effectiveness in wastewater reclamation, a rainfall index is taken into account as a useful input in the model that provides the ﬂexibility needed in decision-making process in accordance with the weather conditions observed. Research ﬁndings indicate that a well-trained neural network model is helpful in the assessment of wastewater reclamation practice to achieve signiﬁcant cost savings with modest efforts in on-line sampling and analysis.},
