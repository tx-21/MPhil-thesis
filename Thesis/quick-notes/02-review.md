## __Introduction__
---
@\cite{wuDeepTransformerModels2020}
1.  Models for times series data are developed from mechanistic approaches to statistical and machine learning methods.
    * Explain how mechanistic models work and give examples.
        * The author here make example of the compartmental methods (SIR) for simulating disease spreading dynamics.
    * Explain how statistical and machine learning methods works and give examples.
        * Examples are: AR families, recurrent neural networks. and could list the limitation of the models.
2. Introduce the basics of Transformer. 
    * Transformer-based models have the potential to model complex dynamics of time series data that are challenging for sequence models.
