### One-step-ahead Forecasting Using ILI Data Alone
* Explaines the metrics were used  
In our first experiment, we tested whether our Transformer- based model could predict the ILI ratio one-week ahead from 10 weeks of historical datapoints. For evaluation, the trained global model performs one-step ahead prediction for each state using the testing data set. Pearson correlation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values were calculated for each state.

### One-step-ahead Forecasting Using Feature Vectors
* By adding more feature vectors and then compare the model performance.
