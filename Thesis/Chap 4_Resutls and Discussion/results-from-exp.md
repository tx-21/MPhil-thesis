# RESULTS
## Exp-1 (NH$_{3}$N baseline model)
* The results showed LSTM was the best performanced model in average.
* All the pre-processing methods improved the model performance significantly compared to train model with observed NH$_{3}$N, except or has the poorest results for LSTM model.
* ew3 and ew3 with LSTM model have the best performance.
* Since of other models, the performance of each model with differect pro-processing methods are different, therefore, i will use all the preprocessing method in the next optimization stage.
## Exp-2
(use LSTM + ew2/3/4, sg5/7/9, or)

## Exp-5
* All the pre-processing methods improved the model performance significantly compared to train model with observed NH$_{3}$N.
* LSTM has the best performance in average.

## Exp-6
(use LSTM + ew2/3/4, sg5/7/9, or)
