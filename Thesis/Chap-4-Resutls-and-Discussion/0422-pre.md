* Result 1
    * Pre-processed datasets trained with GRU and LSTM generate better model forecasting results.
    * The test loss mean of GRU and LSTM algorithms is listed from lowest to highest, and the validation loss is also listed for evaluation of model performance.
    * For a successful trained model, both train and validation should be low, and the test loss should have positive correlation with the validation loss.
    * In the case of table 1, I have observed that the top trained models didn't have the top performance accordingly.
