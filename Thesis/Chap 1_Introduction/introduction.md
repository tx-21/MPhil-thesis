## When explaining the first objective
In order to do this, we start by creating different machine learning models and after that, __we select the best performing model as the baseline model.__
## Feature engineering
Feature engineering (or feature extraction) is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data. The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process,
