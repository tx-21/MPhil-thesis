## When explaining the first objective
In order to do this, we start by creating different machine learning models and after that, __we select the best performing model as the baseline model.__
## Feature engineering
Feature engineering (or feature extraction) is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data. The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process, 

# Research trend
* The use of Neural networks instead of PI and other model controls
  * It happens we have access to the SWHEPP water monitoring, and the goal is to demonstrate how to use machine learning to help building a forecast model.
