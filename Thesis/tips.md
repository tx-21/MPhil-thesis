# Writing objectives
Those objectives break down each component of your research project into smaller portions, each representing a key section of it. Thus, almost all dissertations and theses are organized into numbered lists, with each item getting its own chapter.
* Specific  
Is the action you intend to take unclear, or is it focused and well-defined?
* Assessable:  
What method will you use to measure your progress and determine when you have accomplished your goal?
* Obtainable  
Do you have the necessary support, resources, and facilities to execute the project?
* Relevant:  
Does the action you propose support the achievement of your research aim?
*  Timebound:  
Are you realistically able to complete the action within the given timeframe?
